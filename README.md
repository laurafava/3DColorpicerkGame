# 3DColorpicerkGame

DESCRIPTION

This is a little Game, where the Player has a certain amount of threedimensional cubes floating through space. Each cube has a random color and its the goal to find the cube identical with the color portrayed on the upper right corner. The challenge is to click on the right cube without loosing the given amount of lives (for each click on a wrong cube a life is lost).
To add additional complexity, the cubes change their shape and size when the mouse hoovers over them.

Furthermore there are various amounts of Cubes appearing on the screen and three Levels of difficulties: At the easy Level the cubes move at different speeds around their own axis and also slowly through the space. At the intermediate Level the cubes move through the space faster and in more directions. At the hardest Level the cubes also move "further" away from the viewer so they get smaller and it puts the player under time pressure.
